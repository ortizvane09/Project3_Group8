We are a luxury apparel company looking to open a location in Texas. We want to decide where would be a good location to maximize the chances for success. We will look at the ecomonic information available for all 253 counties within Texas to see if there is a best match.

We will be accessing the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis API to collect information about the per capitol information for all the counties in Texas.

We hope to find which counties have the highest income per capita and a large enough population to support our store. If we are able, we will also look at the spending on clothing and apparel per capita for the Texas counties.
